# Oaks Taverners Cricket Club

Oaks Taverners Cricket Club is a fictitious social cricket club based in the outskirts of Dublin in Knocklyon, which is also an extension to an official cricket club which is called Oaks Taverners Cricket Club. The purpose of the club is to play the game of cricket at a non cometitive way in a much shorter time frame than regular cricket matches which invites anyone from experienced veterans to first time players alike to join in the fun of playing cricket. Taverners Cricket in real life is an existing non competitive league in Dublin and beyond.

The purpose of this website is to introduce and promote the Taverners cricket club to anyone interested in joining. It gives all the information anyone needs to know about the club and how it (and Taverners Cricket) functions. The main purpose is to ease people into the club without blasting them with too much information but expressing the simplicity and fun of it all. Once a member desides to join, they will obviously be invited to a whatsapp group and email feed which will give them all the precise information needed on playing and other events.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

- The website has a simple yet expressive design, clean and clear to find and see what you want, not too demaning on new members eyes.

- Provide potential members the location and contact details of the club

- Present Information needed to know about the club, about the cricket and a simple explainintion how to play cricket.

- Present a display of Images of a cricketing nature as well as the fun and social aspects of the club.

### Typography

I used two fonts in this website, which consists of Germania One for the headings and Urbanist for the paragraphs. San Serif was used as a fallback for both headings and paragraphs. I chose the combonations myself. Germania One for the medieval vibe I thought suited well with the term Oaks, Cricket and the Scenic Images I have used, and Urbanist for the clarity and simplicity to make the content readable and easy on the eye.

### Color Schemes

![Color scheme image](documentation/color-scheme.png)

The colors I have used are very simple. I have used Dark Green (#006400) to stand out from the other color of white, but mostly to represent the scenic grounds Ireland has to offer aswell as the color of greenery represented on cricket feilds. And the simple color of White (#FFFFFF) which is what cricketers clothes colors are, its simple enough, as the page naturally comes in white, and so do the clothes!

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to mockup the website and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages. Obviously, there is now a difference from the mockup to the finished website as new inspirations occurred to me whilst working on the project, the most notable would be adding the Gallery as a seperate page and moving the map in the contact us page to the bottom.
