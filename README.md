# Oaks Taverners Cricket Club

![Oaks Taverners Cricket Club across devices](documentation/responsive.png)

Oaks Taverners Cricket Club is a fictitious social cricket club based in the outskirts of Dublin in Knocklyon, which is also an extension to an official cricket club which is called Oaks Taverners Cricket Club. The purpose of the club is to play the game of cricket at a non cometitive way in a much shorter time frame than regular cricket matches which invites anyone from experienced veterans to first time players alike to join in the fun of playing cricket. Taverners Cricket in real life is an existing non competitive league in Dublin and beyond.

The purpose of this website is to introduce and promote the Taverners cricket club to anyone interested in joining. It gives all the information anyone needs to know about the club and how it (and Taverners Cricket) functions. The main purpose is to ease people into the club without blasting them with too much information but expressing the simplicity and fun of it all. Once a member desides to join, they will obviously be invited to a whatsapp group and email feed which will give them all the precise information needed on playing and other events.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

- The website has a simple yet expressive design, clean and clear to find and see what you want, not too demaning on new members eyes.

- Provide potential members the location and contact details of the club

- Present Information needed to know about the club, about the cricket and a simple explainintion how to play cricket.

- Present a display of Images of a cricketing nature as well as the fun and social aspects of the club.

- Offer an option to contact the club with any messages or questions potential members would like to say.

### User Stories

- As a potential member I would like the website to be informative enough for me to be interested.

* As a potential member I would like to not be overloaded with information when looking up the dtails about the club

* As a potential member I would like to see the play in action and see its social interation without being intimidated by any competitivity.

* As a potential member I woul like to see that I will be welcome, no matter what my cricketing background is.

* As a potential member I would like to see the location of the club.

* As a potential member I would like a space where I can contact someone about any queries I have about the club.

### Typography

I used two fonts in this website, which consists of Germania One for the headings and Urbanist for the paragraphs. San Serif was used as a fallback for both headings and paragraphs. I chose the combonations myself. Germania One for the medieval vibe I thought suited well with the term Oaks, Cricket and the Scenic Images I have used, and Urbanist for the clarity and simplicity to make the content readable and easy on the eye.

### Color Schemes

![Color scheme image](documentation/color-scheme.png)

The colors I have used are very simple. I have used Dark Green (#006400) to stand out from the other color of white, but mostly to represent the scenic grounds Ireland has to offer aswell as the color of greenery represented on cricket feilds. And the simple color of White (#FFFFFF) which is what cricketers clothes colors are, its simple enough, as the page naturally comes in white, and so do the clothes!

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to mockup the website and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages. Obviously, there is now a difference from the mockup to the finished website as new inspirations occurred to me whilst working on the project, the most notable would be adding the Gallery as a seperate page and moving the map in the contact us page to the bottom.

### Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services were used to validate all pages of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.

#### W3C Markup Validator

![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/html-validator1.png)
![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/html-validator2.png)
![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/html-validator3.png)
![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/html-validator4.png)
![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/html-validator5.png)

There were originally a few errors in my W3C Markup Validator test, this is how I fixed them.

- I forgot to add an l to the ul element for the navagation code, for all pages, therefore I added the l to the u making it ul, I then wrote a CSS for the ul code to make sure the navagation menu stays in its place. This fixed the first 4 errors.

- The next few errors had to do with the map which I developed using Google Maps iframe Generator, I removed the width, frameborder, scrolling, margin-height and margin-width from the html code as it is obsolete. Then I added CSS code for the Map to do what I needed it to do. I also removed the a href text from the map code as it was obsolete too.

- There was also a rouge a implemented in the social links by accident, so I removed it.

![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/final-html-validator.png)

So I am left with 2 warnings where its warning me that the sections lack headings, however the sections do not need the use of headings in this case.

#### W3C CSS Validator

![W3C CSS Validator](documentation/css-validator.png)

No errors were found in the W3C CSS Validator test.
