                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The Oaks are a mixed group of talented (and not so talented) ex-cricketers and first timers alike.
                    Most members are
                    affiliated with the official Oaks Cricket Club in some way. The age of our Players range from
                    18 to over 70 years.
                    Grandsons have played with Grandfathers with little or no resulting arguments. Like all good
                    Taverners we pride
                    ourselves in our ability to "Talk a good game" without feeling the need to actually play a good
                    one. The Club is a branch of the official club, which is part of the taverners league. </p>

                <h2>Cricketing Info</h2>
                <p>Taverners Cricket usually lasts around two and a half to three hours, with sambos and drinks after
                    (which could last even longer!). It is usually payed in the format of 15 overs of 8 balls or just a
                    plain T20, rules and additional overs will be discussed between the teams playing. Matches are
                    usually played on a friday evening at 6 pm with "practise" sessions every wednesday evening. The
                    Taverners season begins and ends at the same time of any Irish cricketing season, between the end of
                    May to the beginning of September. To be a part of the Taverners club will be 100 Euros for the
                    season, with the occasional pitch maintenance costs needed to keep our ground in pristene condition
                    (usually around 25Euros a year). Cricketing equiptment is provided.

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>The main objective in cricket is simple: The batsmen aim to score more runs than the other team, while the
            bowlers and
            fielders try to stop them.



            Batting
            Runs are scored when a batsmen hits the ball and runs to the other end of the pitch before the fielders can
            throw it
            back. If the ball is hit well it can go all the way to the boundary and the batsmen gets an automatic four
            runs, without
            having to actually run.

            Bowling
            The bowler's main job is to get the batsmen out. The bowler does this by running in and delivering the ball
            to the
            batsmen.</p>
